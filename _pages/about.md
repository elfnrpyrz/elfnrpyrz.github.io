Hi! I'm Elif. I'm a cognitive scientist interested in the origins of our complex social abilities. Most of my research to date focused on how children represent false beliefs, and how this relates to inhibitory control. What makes me most excited about this line of work is exploring the immense variability between and within individuals. In my research, I apply longitudinal single-case studies as well as computational models. I'm curious in which others ways children flexibly use complex representations to quickly navigate their social context, and the cognitive factors influencing how well they make use of these representations.

I'm currently a PhD candidate in the [Department of Psychology](https://psych.rutgers.edu/welcome) and [Center for Cognitive Science] (https://ruccs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/about-cognitive-science) in Rutgers University - New Brunswick, working with [Alan Leslie](https://psych.rutgers.edu/people/chair-v-cs/faculty-profile/124-alan-leslie). I got my M.S in January 2021 from the same department. Before coming to Rutgers, I received my BS in [Psychology](https://psy.metu.edu.tr) from Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkiye.

I'm currently looking for Post-doctoral positions!
